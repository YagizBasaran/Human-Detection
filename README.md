# OpenCV Programs

This repositoriy contains of **7** OpenCV projects. Which will be described at the bottom with pictures and details. Thanks for looking to it.

❗❗❗❗***Best one is at the bottom do not forget to check that out!***


- Photos or videos should be in the same file with the project.
- Dont forget to add quotation marks. 
- Dont forget to change \ with / while writing path.
- And, dont forget to add any.jpg or any.mp4 to end of the path.
- Ex: "C:/Users/Source/Repos/OpenCVPrograms/face1.jpg"

## 1) Photo, Video and Camera opener
- In this file, one can open a video, photo or any camera (assuming they know their channel). Just copy and paste the path in the main function.

## 4) Warp Perspective
- This programs objective is to give the user bird's eye view of items. Use pictures with bad perspectives. Go to paint and get coordinates of all corners. And type them to "src" array. The positions are described in the code. HD pictures would work better.

## 5) Find Colour
- Authors favourite. With the help of TrackBar find your wanted colour. All you have to do this play around with it until everything is black except ur wanted colour, it will be white. Then, one can use it to program other systems with this color finder while just programming do this if black do that if white.

## 6) Find Shape (Demo)
- This program helps to find shapes. It is demo right now because author is lazy and impatient to code which shape is which when more corners occur.

# 7) Face Detection
- This program detects human faces from anywhere. Even if they are more than one. From photos or live camera it will work. One problem is do not forget to put "haarcascade" xml file to the project folder.
